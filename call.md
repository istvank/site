The Web Conference 2020 developers track presents an opportunity to share the latest developments across the technical community, both in terms of technologies, and in terms of tooling. We will be running a half day of informal sessions with presentations and demonstrations showcasing community expertise and progress:

- What cool development tools, frameworks, languages and technologies could you not get on without?
- What do you use or see as new developments that will make your developer life easier or more productive?
- How do you navigate the increasingly large landscape of technologies and tools, and how can you help others to better navigate this landscape?

While we are open to any contributions that are relevant for the Web space, here are a few areas that we are particularly interested in:

- HTML5 space and Web apps in general
- Web technologies for APIs, and tooling for Web APIs (both for the provider and consumer side of APIs)
- Peer-to-peer technologies and tooling for the Web
- Streaming and event-based technologies and tooling for the Web
- Web-scale information processing
- Autonomy on the Web: Agents, bots, etc.

Submissions should take the form of a title and short description detailing what will be shared with the community (including the specific platform and/or technologies you will be showcasing). Be as specific and detailed as you need to be so that the program committee can understand your submission and presentation plan.

There is no need to submit full papers, but we will make any materials available on this site that authors wish to make public.

- Submission deadline: January 20, 2020
- Acceptance notification: February 10, 2020
- Submission site: [Easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=www2020devtrack)

The Web Conference 2020 Developers Track is part of [The Web Conference 2020](https://www2020.thewebconf.org/) in Taipei, Taiwan. Participation in the developers track will require registration for the conference.
